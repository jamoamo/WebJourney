# Task List Creation Guide for Coding Agents

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for analyzing Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and creating actionable, well-organized task lists that enable efficient development execution. Use this guide when you need to break down complex requirements into manageable, implementable tasks.

## When to Use This Guide

- **After receiving a PRD**: Break down requirements into actionable tasks
- **Before starting development**: Create a structured implementation plan
- **During sprint planning**: Organize tasks by priority and dependencies
- **For complex features**: Ensure nothing is overlooked in implementation

## Core Principles

### 1. Completeness
- Extract **every** requirement from the PRD
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements
- Don't forget testing, documentation, and deployment tasks

### 2. Granularity
- Break tasks into **2-8 hour** work chunks
- Each task should have a clear definition of "done"
- Avoid overly broad tasks like "implement user authentication"

### 3. Dependency Management
- Identify prerequisite relationships between tasks
- Order tasks logically for efficient development flow
- Account for external dependencies (APIs, third-party services)

### 4. Testability
- Include testing tasks for each feature
- Separate unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- Plan for both positive and negative test cases

## PRD Analysis Process

### Step 1: Initial PRD Review
Read through the entire PRD to understand:
- **Problem being solved**
- **Target users and personas**
- **Core features and functionality**
- **Technical constraints and requirements**
- **Success metrics and acceptance criteria**

### Step 2: Requirement Extraction
Go through each section systematically:

#### From Executive Summary
- [ ] Identify high-level deliverables
- [ ] Extract key success metrics
- [ ] Note any timeline constraints

#### From Problem Definition
- [ ] Understand context and constraints
- [ ] Identify any research or validation tasks needed

#### From Solution Overview
- [ ] List all major features and capabilities
- [ ] Identify integration points
- [ ] Note any architectural decisions

#### From User Stories
- [ ] Convert each user story into implementation tasks
- [ ] Extract acceptance criteria as test scenarios
- [ ] Identify UI/UX requirements

#### From Technical Requirements
- [ ] List all functional requirements
- [ ] Extract non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- [ ] Identify infrastructure and deployment needs

#### From Technical Design
- [ ] Break down architecture into components
- [ ] Extract API endpoints and data models
- [ ] Identify database schema changes

#### From Implementation Plan
- [ ] Respect existing phase boundaries
- [ ] Extract any specific sequencing requirements
- [ ] Note milestone deliverables

## Task Creation Framework

- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion]

### Technical Details

```

## Task Prioritization Strategy

### Priority Levels

#### P0 - Critical Path
- Foundation components required by other tasks
- Core user workflows (MVP features)
- Security and authentication (if required)

#### P1 - High Priority
- Primary features from user stories
- Essential integrations
- Core business logic

#### P2 - Medium Priority
- Secondary features
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced user experience features

#### P3 - Low Priority
- Nice-to-have features
- Advanced configuration options
- Non-essential integrations

### Dependency Mapping

1. **Identify Prerequisites**: What must exist before this task can start?
2. **Map Logical Flow**: What's the natural order of implementation?
3. **Consider Parallel Work**: What can be done simultaneously?
4. **Account for Testing**: When can testing tasks be executed?
