# PRD Creation Guide for Coding Agents

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that effectively communicate product vision, requirements, and implementation details to development teams and stakeholders.

## What is a PRD?

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a comprehensive document that outlines:
- **What** the product should do
- **Why** it's needed
- **Who** it's for
- **How** it should work
- **When** it should be delivered

## PRD Structure Template

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Purpose**: One-paragraph overview of the entire project
- **Key Elements**:
  - Problem statement
  - Proposed solution
  - Business value
  - Success metrics

### 2. Problem Definition
- **Current State**: What exists today
- **Pain Points**: Specific issues users face
- **Root Causes**: Why these problems exist
- **Impact**: Business/user impact of not solving

### 3. Solution Overview
- **High-Level Approach**: How we'll solve the problem
- **Key Features**: Main capabilities
- **Success Criteria**: How we'll measure success
- **Non-Goals**: What we explicitly won't do

### 4. User Stories & Requirements

#### 4.1 User Personas
```
Primary User: [Role/Title]
- Background: [Context]
- Goals: [What they want to achieve]
- Pain Points: [Current challenges]
- Technical Proficiency: [Skill level]
```

#### 4.2 User Stories Format
```
As a [user type],
I want [functionality],
So that [benefit/value].

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
```

### 5. Technical Requirements

#### 5.1 Functional Requirements

- **Mitigation Strategies**: How to address each risk

## Best Practices for PRD Creation

### 1. Clarity & Specificity
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Avoid technical jargon when possible
- Define all acronyms and domain-specific terms
- Include specific examples and use cases

### 2. User-Centric Approach
- Start with user needs, not technical solutions
- Include actual user quotes or feedback when available
- Validate assumptions with user research
- Prioritize features based on user value

### 3. Measurable Success Criteria
- Define quantifiable metrics
- Include baseline measurements
- Set realistic targets with timelines
- Align metrics with business objectives

### 4. Visual Communication
- Use diagrams for complex workflows
- Include mockups or wireframes
- Create user journey maps
- Use tables for comparing options

### 5. Iterative Development
- Plan for incremental delivery
- Define minimum viable product (MVP)
- Include feedback loops
- Allow for requirement evolution

## PRD Review Checklist

### Content Completeness
- [ ] Problem clearly defined with evidence
- [ ] Solution addresses root causes
- [ ] User stories are complete with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical requirements are specific and testable
- [ ] Implementation plan is realistic and detailed
- [ ] Success metrics are defined and measurable

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Document is well-structured and easy to navigate
- [ ] Language is clear and professional
- [ ] All stakeholders are identified
- [ ] Assumptions are explicitly stated
- [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation plans

### Stakeholder Alignment
- [ ] Business objectives are clearly linked
- [ ] User needs are prioritized appropriately
- [ ] Technical constraints are acknowledged
- [ ] Timeline is realistic and agreed upon

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Solution-First Thinking
- **Problem**: Starting with a technical solution instead of user problem
- **Fix**: Always begin with problem definition and user research

### 2. Scope Creep
- **Problem**: Requirements growing beyond original intent
- **Fix**: Clearly define what's in-scope and out-of-scope

### 3. Vague Requirements
- **Problem**: Ambiguous or untestable requirements
- **Fix**: Use specific, measurable criteria

### 4. Missing Edge Cases
- **Problem**: Not considering error conditions or unusual scenarios
- **Fix**: Include comprehensive error handling and edge case analysis

### 5. Unrealistic Timeline
- **Problem**: Underestimating development complexity
- **Fix**: Include buffer time and validate estimates with engineering team

## Questions to Ask Stakeholders

1. What's your current workflow?
2. What's most frustrating about the current solution?
3. What would make your job easier?
4. How do you currently measure success?
5. What features are absolutely essential?

### Technical Stakeholders
1. What are our technical constraints?
2. What's our current system architecture?
3. What security requirements do we have?
4. What's our deployment pipeline?
5. What monitoring and alerting do we need?
