- Risk analysis and success metrics

### 🏗️ [architecture-overview.md](./architecture-overview.md)
**Technical Architecture** - Detailed technical design including:
- Current state analysis of existing infrastructure
- Proposed architecture with detailed component breakdown
- Integration patterns with existing browser arguments system
- Deployment patterns and configuration strategies

### 🛠️ [implementation-milestones.md](./implementation-milestones.md)
**Implementation Plan** - Detailed milestone breakdown including:
- 5 implementation phases with clear deliverables
- Acceptance criteria for each milestone
- Testing strategies and risk mitigation
- Timeline and resource allocation

### 💡 [usage-examples.md](./usage-examples.md)
**Usage Examples** - Comprehensive code examples including:
- Basic and advanced configuration patterns
- Multi-browser and load balancing setups
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment examples
- Enterprise integration and monitoring examples

## Quick Start

For a quick overview of the hub support initiative:

1. **Read the [main PRD](./hub-support.md)** for complete requirements and scope
2. **Review [architecture overview](./architecture-overview.md)** for technical approach
3. **Check [usage examples](./usage-examples.md)** for implementation patterns
4. **Follow [implementation milestones](./implementation-milestones.md)** for development plan

## Key Features

The hub support initiative will add the following capabilities to WebJourney:

### 🌐 **Native Hub Connectivity**
- First-class support for Selenium Hub and Grid
- Seamless switching between local and remote execution
- Multiple hub configuration options (programmatic, environment variables, YAML)

### 🔄 **Intelligent Browser Strategies**
- Hub-aware strategies with automatic fallback to local execution
- Load balancing across multiple hub endpoints
- Health monitoring and automatic failover

### ⚙️ **Enterprise-Grade Features**
- Advanced node selection and custom capabilities
- Authentication and TLS support
- Session management and connection pooling
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

### 🔧 **Seamless Integration**
- 100% backward compatibility with existing code
- Leverages existing browser arguments and capability serialization
- Consistent API patterns with current WebJourney design

## Architecture Highlights

### Current Strengths We're Building On
✅ **Grid-compatible capability serialization** - Already works perfectly  
✅ **Advanced browser arguments system** - Seamlessly integrates with hubs  
✅ **Multi-browser support** - Chrome, Firefox, Edge all ready  
✅ **Comprehensive testing infrastructure** - Grid testing already in place  

### New Capabilities We're Adding
🆕 **Hub configuration management** - Multiple configuration sources  
🆕 **Remote browser factories** - RemoteWebDriver-based implementations  
🆕 **Intelligent strategies** - Hub-aware selection with fallback  
🆕 **Advanced Grid features** - Node selection, authentication, monitoring  

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Core hub configuration infrastructure and extended browser options

### Phase 2: Remote Factories (Weeks 3-4)
RemoteWebDriver-based browser factories for all supported browsers

### Phase 3: Intelligent Strategies (Weeks 5-6)
Hub-aware browser selection with health monitoring and fallback

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
Enterprise features like authentication, node selection, and observability

### Phase 5: Documentation (Weeks 9-10)
Comprehensive documentation, migration guides, and release preparation

## Success Criteria

### Functional Goals
- **100% feature parity** between local and remote execution
- **Seamless fallback** from hub to local execution on failures
- **Zero breaking changes** for existing WebJourney users
- **Enterprise-ready** authentication and security features

### Performance Goals
- **<10% overhead** for remote execution vs direct RemoteWebDriver
- **<500ms additional latency** for hub connectivity
- **>99.9% reliability** for hub connection management
- **Efficient resource usage** with connection pooling and session management

### Adoption Goals
- **<1 hour setup time** for typical hub deployments
- **<1 day migration time** from custom implementations
- **Comprehensive documentation** with real-world examples
- **Active community adoption** in open source projects

## Getting Involved

This PRD represents a comprehensive plan for adding hub support to WebJourney. For implementation:

1. **Review the technical architecture** to understand integration points
2. **Follow the milestone plan** for systematic development
3. **Use the examples** as implementation guidance
4. **Contribute feedback** on requirements and design decisions
