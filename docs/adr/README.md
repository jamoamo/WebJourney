# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the WebJourney project. ADRs are short text documents that capture a single architectural decision, its context, the options considered, and the chosen solution. They serve as a historical log of important design decisions and their rationale, helping new team members understand the system's evolution and guiding future development.

## Why use ADRs?

*   **Documentation:** Provides a clear and concise record of architectural decisions.
*   **Communication:** Ensures all team members understand the rationale behind decisions.
*   **Consistency:** Promotes consistent application of architectural principles.
*   **Accountability:** Assigns ownership to decisions.
*   **Learning:** Helps the team learn from past decisions.

## How to create a new ADR:

1.  **Copy the template:** Start by copying the `adr-template.md` to a new file, naming it `NNNN-decision-summary.md`, where `NNNN` is the next sequential number (e.g., `0001-use-maven.md`).
2.  **Fill in the sections:** Complete all sections of the template:
    *   **Title:** A concise summary of the decision.
    *   **Status:** Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Superseded.
    *   **Context:** The forces and challenges leading to the decision.
    *   **Decision:** The chosen solution.
    *   **Consequences:** The positive and negative impacts of the decision.
3.  **Submit for review:** Create a pull request with your new ADR for team review.
4.  **Merge:** Once approved, merge the ADR into the `main` branch.

## ADR Statuses:

*   **Proposed:** The ADR is in draft and awaiting review.
*   **Accepted:** The decision has been agreed upon and will be implemented.
*   **Rejected:** The decision was not approved.
*   **Superseded:** The decision has been replaced by a newer ADR.
