# PRD: Async and Parallel Execution Framework

## 1. Executive Summary

WebJourney currently supports only synchronous, single-threaded web automation journeys, creating performance bottlenecks and limiting scalability for enterprise users. This PRD outlines the development of an Async and Parallel Execution Framework that will enable concurrent journey execution, browser session pooling, and non-blocking operations.

**Key Business Value**: Reduce journey execution time by 60-80% for multiple concurrent journeys while maintaining backward compatibility with existing synchronous API.

**Success Metrics**: 
- Execute 10 concurrent journeys in 25% of the time compared to sequential execution
- Maintain 99.9% API compatibility with existing synchronous implementation
- Achieve sub-100ms overhead for async framework initialization

## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1 Current State
WebJourney operates with the following limitations:
- **Synchronous Execution**: All journey steps execute sequentially, blocking the calling thread
- **Single Browser Session**: Each journey requires a dedicated browser instance throughout execution
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Browser resources remain idle during wait operations and network requests
- **Poor Scalability**: Cannot efficiently handle multiple concurrent journeys

### 2.2 Pain Points
**Enterprise Users**:
- "We need to run 50+ test scenarios in parallel, but WebJourney forces us to run them sequentially, taking hours instead of minutes"
- "Our CI/CD pipeline is bottlenecked by WebJourney's synchronous execution"

**Performance Testing Teams**:
- "We can't simulate realistic user load because each journey blocks a thread"
- "Browser resources are wasted during network waits and page load times"

**Development Teams**:
- "Integration tests take too long to run, slowing down our development cycle"
- "We need better resource utilization for our automated testing infrastructure"

### 2.3 Root Causes
1. **Architecture Limitation**: Current design assumes synchronous, single-threaded execution
2. **Resource Management**: No pooling or sharing of browser instances
3. **Blocking Operations**: All WebDriver operations block the executing thread
4. **Lack of Concurrency Primitives**: No built-in support for parallel execution patterns

### 2.4 Impact
- **Development Velocity**: Slow test execution delays development cycles
- **Resource Costs**: Inefficient resource utilization increases infrastructure costs
- **User Experience**: Long-running automation tasks impact user productivity
- **Scalability**: Cannot meet enterprise-scale automation requirements

## 3. Solution Overview

### 3.1 High-Level Approach
Implement an async-first execution framework that enables:
- **Concurrent Journey Execution**: Multiple journeys running simultaneously
- **Browser Resource Pooling**: Shared browser instances across journeys
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Asynchronous action execution with CompletableFuture
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing synchronous API remains unchanged

### 3.2 Key Features
1. **AsyncJourneyExecutor**: New API for concurrent journey execution
2. **BrowserPool**: Managed pool of browser instances for resource sharing
3. **AsyncWebAction**: Base class for non-blocking action implementations
4. **AsyncJourneyContext**: Enhanced context with async capabilities

### 3.3 Success Criteria
- **Performance**: 60-80% reduction in total execution time for multiple journeys
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility with existing synchronous API
- **Resource Efficiency**: 50% reduction in browser resource usage
- **Scalability**: Support for 50+ concurrent journeys

### 3.4 Non-Goals
- Rewriting existing synchronous actions (maintained for compatibility)
- Changing the core WebJourney annotation-based mapping system
- Implementing distributed execution across multiple machines

## 4. User Stories & Requirements

### 4.2 User Stories

#### Story 1: Concurrent Journey Execution
```
As a QA Automation Engineer,
I want to execute multiple WebJourney test scenarios concurrently,
So that I can reduce my test suite execution time from hours to minutes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given 10 independent journey scenarios, when executed concurrently, then total execution time is <30% of sequential execution
- [ ] Given concurrent execution, when any journey fails, then other journeys continue unaffected
- [ ] Given concurrent execution, when all journeys complete, then results are aggregated and reported
```

#### Story 2: Browser Resource Pooling
```
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want WebJourney to share browser instances across multiple journeys,
So that I can reduce infrastructure costs and improve resource utilization.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given a browser pool of size 5, when 10 journeys execute, then maximum 5 browser instances are active
- [ ] Given a browser instance in the pool, when a journey completes, then the browser is available for reuse
- [ ] Given browser pool configuration, when pool is full, then new journeys wait for available browsers
```

#### Story 3: Non-blocking Action Execution
```
As a Performance Test Engineer,
I want individual actions within a journey to execute asynchronously,
So that I can overlap wait times and network operations for better efficiency.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given an async action, when executed, then calling thread is not blocked
- [ ] Given multiple async actions, when executed in sequence, then they can overlap execution
- [ ] Given async action completion, when result is needed, then it's available via CompletableFuture
```

#### Story 4: Backward Compatibility
```
As a QA Automation Engineer,
I want my existing synchronous WebJourney code to continue working,
So that I don't need to rewrite existing test automation.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given existing synchronous journey code, when executed, then it works without modification
- [ ] Given existing WebTraveller usage, when called, then it behaves identically to current version
- [ ] Given existing action classes, when used, then they execute successfully in both sync and async contexts
```
