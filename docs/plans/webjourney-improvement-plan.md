# WebJourney Library Improvement Plan

## Project Overview

WebJourney is a Java library for automating web interactions through the concept of sequential web actions, built on top of Selenium. The library provides a fluent API for defining web automation workflows and includes a test utility module for testing without real browsers.

**Current Version:** 3.3.1-SNAPSHOT  
**Java Version:** 21  
**Main Dependencies:** Selenium 4.33.0, SLF4J, Apache Commons, Guava, Lombok

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Strengths
- Well-structured multi-module Maven project
- Clean separation between core library and test utilities
- Uses modern Java 21 features
- Comprehensive action types (navigation, form completion, conditional actions)
- Proper logging with SLF4J
- Builder pattern implementation for journey construction
- Exception handling with breadcrumb tracking
- MIT license for open source compatibility

### Areas for Improvement
- Limited documentation and examples
- Basic CI/CD workflow (only Windows)
- Missing code quality metrics and reporting
- No performance testing framework
